    <p>
      My name is Herb Cleary, I'm a college student who is currently studying for a level 2 BTEC in IT.
      I'm an artist, musician and web designer who likes to read, write and create things in my free time. 
    </p>
      <p>
        I'm a fast learner with a wide and versatile set of skills useful for a variety of things. I can quickly pick up and learn new things without much issue and I like to think I'm a friendly guy with a big heart who can work with others as a team to get things done.

      <p>
      I've only worked two jobs so far. As part of my L1 required work experience I worked at Scope March charity shop, for 6 weeks brief relief of Covid restrictions the UK had in November - December before the 2nd lockdown. I was the only student in my class to get any work experience that year.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Currently i'm employed at Mill Hill garage having done L2 work experience with them before moving on to full time work with them with 6 months now having passed since I started.
