# Task 1

## Audience, purpose and design

#

When making my portfolio website I decided early on that I wanted the design to be personal and professional. I wanted to showcase the right aspects of me to a potential employer to make myself and my skills desirable for their needs.

My main intended audience for the website is to interest a company or potential employer looking for someone in the IT department to fill in a role of some kind related to my skill-set.

And so the purpose of course was to showcase my desirable skills that an employer would want/need from me to fill said role.

At first I wasn't quite sure what kind of skills to include because my skill-set is a bit of a jumbled mess but I figured that with the growing beast that is the IT industry my variety of versatile skills can be quite

Because of that the main purpose of the website is to show an possible employer that I have a versatile skill-set and that I could be useful for a variety of possible needed roles. Maybe a poster designer with my photoshop and different MOS application experience, perhaps a Logo designer working to create the company's new logo, a Sound designer or video editor to create video advertisements.

In conclusion...

The main audience of the website are employers looking to fill a general IT skills role. And the main purpose of the website is to showcase my versatility and wide skill-set off to said employers looking for someone to fill that IT role.

#

## Designs

#

In this following section I'll be showcasing:

+ A timeline for the project
+ A storyboard of the layout and content of my pages
+ A structure chart of navigation routes
+ A list of ready-made assets i'm using and their sources

## Timeline

For the project I came up with this timeline that sets out a rough set of dates that I aim to start and finish the content for each of the 3 tasks and the dates that I had aimed to do so.

## Storyboard

With my storyboard I started off with these first two pages that were pretty underdeveloped.

![earlyboard1](img/earlyboard1.png)
![earlyboard2](img/earlyboard2.png)

I made these designs just from the top of my head after looking at a few portfolios.
Giving it a go I didn't really jive with the vibe of it all so I took a step back and started over. I looked at some more portfolios online and came up with some more ideas of what to use in mine and eventually I made these boards.

![board2](img/boardpg2.png)
![board3](img/boardpg3.png)

I wanted to create something simple and not too complex.

The design was pretty simple and with this new set of boards ready I got to work piecing the website together.

After setting up a basic page I made some progress and tried out using an animated navigation bar that would slide into the page and have links to the other pages.

# Storyboard alterations/progress

![prog1](img/prog1.png)

After starting the building process of my website I changed around how the navigation bar was positioned. I tried it both at the top of the page, where I had originally planned it to be in my storyboard, and then at the bottom of the page which I ended up liking more. I tested it out with a similar animation as before but instead of sliding in from the left of the screen it rises up from the bottom. I liked how the animation worked with it sliding up and decided to deviate from my initial board design to have it below.

I then added a carousel in the center that had the main aspects of my skills that I wanted to show: MOS, Photoshop, 3D Models, Music and website creation.

The portfolio page is similar but slightly different from the initial board design. I kept the block design similar but changed the contents. Instead of one big block showcasing the images and previous works and the smaller block showcasing the info of said big block I changed it to have both block and image be put into one block of their own.

## Navigation chart

Chart 1: Page navigation

Below I have created a chart showing how the pages relate and which page connects where. On the main page you can navigate to either the about me or portfolio pages as it's main option alongside being able to select links embedded to the main carousel that sends you to an individual page relating to the 5 main topics I decided to showcase in my portfolio.

Chart 2: Navigation bar navigation

The same as the page navigation but stylized the way my main navigation bar is.

## Asset list

+ Microsoft Office Specialist awards
+ Level 1 unit work (Logo's, Photoshop, 3D modeling)
+ Unit 13 Website

Aside the use of assets made by me I used very little in terms of others assets aside from borrowing and using snippets of code from the website W3Schools, a website built to teach and inform on how to do a variety of things with CSS or Html code among other things.

Specifically:

+ Overlay effect

<https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_overlay.asp>

+ CSS Animation

<https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp>

Other parts of code have also been lifted from my last project for Unit 13 as it was a nice easy base to start building off.

Other than the code from W3Schools the only other thing I've taken from an outside source are the badge images from Certiport / Microsoft, all of which I myself had earned by taking their exams.

# Portfolio

I want my portfolio to showcase some of my strengths in IT. I'm not too good with the technical parts, like programming a website or even just handling a git hub account without breaking it somehow, so for my achievements that I can show in IT mainly creative things I have done either on the course or off it previously. The following is a list I created that

+ Mos specialist awards (Excel, Word, Powerpoint, Word/Excel Expert)
+ Examples of my photo editing work
+ 3D Modelling Tinkercad
+ Unit 13's phone website
+ Music (Soundcloud)

#

(Creative and a learner)

Learner aspects:

+ Versatile
+ Dedicated to finishing things
+ Quick to adapt to new things

Creative aspects:

+ Photo editing
+ Music
+ Web creation

# Task 2

## Testing plan

#

To make sure the website was working I need to make sure I've tested and checked out to see if the following is all working smoothly.

+ Make sure the page links work properly (Navigation from home to portfolio, portfolio to about me and etc...)

+ Make sure the adjustments work well on different webpage views (Shrunken width different browsers so on)

+ Make sure that the website works on other browsers (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, etc...)

+ And finally, Get feedback from colleagues

#

## Testing

#

+ ## Chrome

  + I started by opening the website on Chrome, the default browser I had been working with, and tested out the links.
