# Storyboard

With my storyboard I started off with these first two pages that were pretty underdeveloped.

I made these designs just from the top of my head after looking at a few portfolios.
Giving it a go I didn't really jive with the vibe of it all so I took a step back and started over. I looked at some more portfolios online and came up with some more ideas of what to use in mine and eventually I made these boards.

I wanted to create something simple and not too complex. Something that showed off my skills but also felt like it represented a piece of me and showed it off.

The design was pretty simple and with this new set of boards ready I got to work piecing the website together.

After setting up a basic page I made some progress and tried out using an animated navigation bar that would slide into the page and have links to the other pages.

Here is how the website is looking so far.

# Asset list



- Microsoft Office Specialist awards
- Level 1 unit work (Logo's, Photoshop, 3D modeling)
- Unit 13 Website

Aside the use of assets made by me I used very little in terms of others assets aside from borrowing and using snippets of code from the website W3Schools, a website built to teach and inform on how to do a variety of things with CSS or Html code among other things.

Specifically:

- Overlay effect

<https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_overlay.asp>

- CSS Animation

<https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp>

Other parts of code have also been lifted from my last project for Unit 13 as it was a nice easy base to start building off.

Other than the code from W3Schools the only other thing I've taken from an outside source are the badge images from Certiport / Microsoft, all of which I myself had earned by taking their exams.
